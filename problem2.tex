\section{Symplectic integration.}

Generalize your ODE program for integrating and plotting the equations of motion using the symplectic leapfrog integrator. I did not have
time to discuss this algorithm in class today, but Iâ€™m attaching a brief
introduction as an appendix to get you started. I will discuss this at the
beginning of class next Thursday.

(a) As a test, use this integrate the pendulum equations of motion in
all regimes:
i. rotation,
ii. libration,
iii. near the unstable equilibrium

(b) Demonstrate that the leapfrog integrator is second-order accurate
in the sense that errors in $\mathbf{q}$ and $\mathbf{p}$ after a timestep $h$ are $O(h^3)$.

(c) Compute the energy conservation for the trajectories in each regime
over about 10,000 orbital periods. Compare the energy conservation for RK4 and leapfrog.
