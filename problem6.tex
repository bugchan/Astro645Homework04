Show that the Jacobi integral is a constant of the motion, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dE_j}{dt}=0
\end{equation}

Show that the Jacobi integral for an orbit may be written as:
\begin{equation}
    E_J = E - \mathbf{\Omega}_p \cdot \mathbf{L}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{\Omega}_p$ is the constant rotation speed of the system whose direction is along the axis of rotation and $L$ is the angular momentum of the orbit.
