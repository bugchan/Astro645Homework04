\section{Turning points in spherical systems}

As we know, the apocenter $r_a$ and pericenter $r_p$ of an orbit in a spherical
stellar system is given by the roots of
\begin{equation}
    2(E -V(r))- \frac{J^2}{r^2}= 0.
\end{equation}

Prove that this equation has either zero or two roots assuming that
the orbit is bound $(E < 0)$ and the potential $V(r)$ is physically realizable (that is: it corresponds to a mass distribution with finite density).

[Hints: (i) Change variables to $u = 1/r$; (ii) use the Poisson equation
after taking the second derivative of equation (1).]
